# 3SRF-04_Arshia_MRA1400

    Here you can a bit about SRF05 and how you can use it in your robots. 

1. ### for learning about the pins in SRF you can open the datasheet from the **_"docs"_** folder and read page **_"1"_**. 
2. ### for the code you can easily open the **_"codes"_** folder and open the **_"project_code.ino"_** file which is an arduino file.

> as you can see there are 5 pins in a SRF05 MODULE.
> * VCC : which is **the 5V pin**.
> * GND : which is **the ground pin**.
> * TRIG, ECHO : which are for **the transmitter and the reciever pins**.
> * OUT : which is used when in **wiring mode**.


# LIBRARIES 

## If you problem with running you code try [INSTALLING THE LIBRARY](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/srf05/) .
> ## scroll down to bottom of the page and find your arduino version to install the **.ZIP** file.
> ## needed to how to [INSTALL AND HOW TO USE](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries).
